# Game Development Club Website

A website containing information and resources for my high school Game Development Club.

## About

The website was made so that people could learn about this club more easily, have an easy way of joining the club at any time during the school year, and make advertising an easier task. Additionally, the website was made to organize different learning resources for club members easier.

This project is my first full stack project to learn about the back-end and front-end workflows of web development.
Using my previous programming experience, I began learning and applying all of the technologies in the technologies section to create this website.

## Project Outcomes

- Strengthened my Javascript, Typescript, and Node.js knowledge
- Learned React, its built in state management, and its ContextAPI
- Learned responsive web design and DRY techniques
- Learned how to create a GraphQL endpoint and connect it with the project front-end via Apollo
- Learned SQL statements and PostgreSQL
- Learned how to deploy a website front-end to AWS Amplify
- Learned functional programming paradigm basics and concepts (currying, higher-order functions)

## Technologies

- React
- Sass
- Typescript
- React Spring
- GraphQL / TypeGraphQL
- TypeORM
- PostgreSQL
- Apollo
- Express

## TODO

- Migrate back-end to React's ContextAPI to save on deployment costs
- ~~Change app to be designed mobile-first and incorpate responsive web design / DRY techniques~~

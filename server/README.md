# Game Development Club Website
A website containing information about my high school game development club! We create 2D games with a pixel art style using Unity.

I am using this project as a way to strengthen my front-end and back-end skills. I plan to improve my React, Typescript, and SCSS with this project and I hope to start learning GraphQL. I will also use this app as my first deploy to AWS Amplify.

## Work In Progress!
The website is still in a WIP state.
